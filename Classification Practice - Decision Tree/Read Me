I have imported pandas
Created a  Decision tree classsification model to predict the weather in the after noon based on morning features like : 
'air_pressure_9am',
'air_temp_9am',
'avg_wind_direction_9am',
'avg_wind_speed_9am',
'max_wind_direction_9am',
'max_wind_speed_9am', and 
'rain_accumulation_9am',
devided the original dataset in training and test dataset.

Checked the accuracy of the model on test data and got the resukt  of : 82.95454545454546 % match
